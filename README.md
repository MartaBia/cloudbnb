# MakersBnB Project Seed

This repo contains the seed codebase for the MakersBnB project in Ruby (using Sinatra and RSpec).

Someone in your team should fork this seed repo to their Github account. Everyone in the team should then clone this fork to their local machine to work on it.

## Setup

### Basic

```bash
# Install gems
bundle install

# Run the tests
rspec

# Run the server (better to do this in a separate terminal).
rackup
```

### Database

To set up the database on your local machine:

```bash
# make sure all dependencies are downloaded
bundle install

# create the databases on your machine
rake db:create

#
```
